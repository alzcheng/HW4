# HW4 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## The Application

I created an application of a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that one can use my application to gauge their progress with their peers.  

## Features

This application will have 4 main screens.  The user will use the buttons to navigate between the starting screen, choosing the questions, and enter in the high scores.  

### Starting Screen for Quiz

### Enter Highscore Screen for Quiz

## Learnings 

1. Code can be better organized.  Can refractor and use JQuery to simplify the code.  Need to think about the organization first in the next homework.
